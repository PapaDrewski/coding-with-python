'''
When you are naming variables there are some rules you have to follow
Variable names can contain only letters numbers and underscores They can start with a letter or an_but not with a number 
for instance you can call variable message_1 but not one_message

Spaces are not allowed in variable names but underscores can be used to separate words in a variable name
for example greeting_message works but greeting message will cause errors


Avoid using python keywords and function names as variable names
for example you can't use the word print as a variable name because python uses it to display output

Variable names should be short but descriptive
for example name is better than n but student_name is even better

Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0

Python is case sensitive which means that variables with different capitalization are different variables
exsample is

 message = "Hello python world!"                                             
print(message)   

Message = "Hello python Crash Course world!"
print(Message)

this will print out two different messages 
Because one of the Ms. are capitalized thuss separate variables



Python variables should be in lower case
You don't get any error if they are in upper cased but it is a good practice to use lower case letters
